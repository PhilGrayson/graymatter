          <h2>Why use Gray Matter IT Services?</h2>
          <h3>Looking for professional help with a project? IT contracting can provide the perfect solution.</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>IT Contractors provide skills to clients on a business-to-business basis, and can often start work within days.</li>
            <li>Contractors are hired for a fixed amount of time for a project. For the client this is an attractive way of budgeting a project as personnnel costs are fixed.</li>
            <li>IT Contractors come with a wealth of knowledge and experience. This gives freelance consultants more precise and in-depth knowledge of their field from a global perspective.</li>
            <li>Contractors are then able to bring this knowledge to their next opportunity benefiting the project team they are working in.</li>
            <li>IT Contractors are legally easier to lay off and contractual terms clearly state the associated costs. Contingency plans are therefore easier to budget should the project be cancelled or paused.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Hardware</h2>
          <p>I have built, configured, monitored and maintained hundreds of Windows and Unix workstations and servers both virtual and physical.</p>
          <p>I can assist in determining your computer system requirements by analysing your personal and professional requirements. This step is essential in deciding what hardware is right for your needs and more importantly budget.</p>
          <p>Requirements Analysis is the process of sitting down and thinking carefully about what your system should be able to do. Starting with looking at your business requirements, this essential first step of computer systems buying process lays the foundation for looking at the systems requirements, and then of course, determining the characteristics of the hardware that will fulfil these needs.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h2>Software</h2>
          <p>Choosing or designing a software system to suit your needs can be confusing to say the least. Not to mention keeping up with all the latest updates plus all the different versions of commercial software available and all their associated patches and hotfixes, then of course there is the complexities of installing the required applications and tailoring them to your needs.</p>
          <p>We can help prepare a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) which is a comprehensive description of the intended purpose of a software system and how it is expected to perform, it lays out the foundation for the development of a new product and for the types of user documentation and media that will be required later in the project development life cycle.</p>

          <h2>Networks</h2>
          <p>As if that isn’t enough, the intricacies of conecting to networks be that Wi-Fi or hardwired to access on-line services such as the internet and cloud solutions can be a veritable minefield, not to mention the inherent dangers accessing such on-line services presents and the levels of protection required to prevent malware or becoming a victim of identity theft can be mind-numbing.</p>
